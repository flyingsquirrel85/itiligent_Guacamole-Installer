This modular suite of build and management scripts makes provisioning a secure Guacamole jump server a breeze. It supports TLS reverse proxy (self-signed or Let's Encrypt), Active Directory integration, multi-factor authentication, Quick Connect & History Recording Storage UI enhancements, a custom UI theme creation tool & template (dark themed), auto database backup, email alerts, internal security hardening options, and a fail2ban policy for defence against brute force attacks. The suite also includes code for an enterprise deployment similar to [Amazon's Guacamole Bastion Cluster](http://netcubed-ami.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/guaws/v2.3.1/cluster/).

## Automatic Installation

üöÄ To start building your Guacamole appliance, paste the below link into a terminal & follow the prompts (**A secure build requires that you do NOT run this script as sudo or root, however the script will prompt for sudo as needed**): 

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyingsquirrel85/itiligent_Guacamole-Installer/main/1-setup.sh && chmod +x 1-setup.sh && ./1-setup.sh
```

## Prerequisites

üîí **Before diving in, make sure you have:**

- **A compatible OS:**
  - **Debian: 12.x or 11.x**
  - **Ubuntu LTS variants: 24.04, 23.04, 22.04**
  - **Raspbian Buster or Bullseye**
  - **Official vendor cloud images equivalent to the above versions.** 
  - **1 CPU core + 2GB RAM for every 25 users (plus minimum RAM & disk space for your selected OS).**
- **Open TCP ports: 22, 80, and 443 (no other services using 80, 8080 & 443)**
- **If selecting either of the TLS reverse proxy options, you must create a PRIVATE DNS record for the internal proxy site, and an additional PUBLIC DNS record if selecting the Let's Encrypt option.**
- **Sudo & wget packages installed**
- **The user running the 1-setup.sh script must have sudo permissions**

## Setup Script Menu

üîß **The main 1-setup.sh script guides you through the installation options in the following steps:**

1. Setup the system hostname & local DNS name (Local DNS must be consistent for TLS proxy).
2. Select either a local MySQL install or use a pre-existing local or remote MySQL instance.
3. Pick an authentication extension: DUO, TOTP, LDAP/Active Directory, or none.
4. Select optional console features: Quick Connect & History Recorded Storage UI integrations.
5. Select the Guacamole front end: Nginx reverse proxy (HTTP or HTTPS) or use the native Guacamole interface on port 8080.
   - If you opt to install Nginx with self-signed TLS:
     - New server & client browser certificates are saved to `$HOME/guac-setup/tls-certs/[date-time]`.
     - Optionally follow on-screen instructions for client certificate import to avoid https browser warnings.

## Custom Installation Instructions

‚öôÔ∏è **To customize with the many available script options:**

- Exit `1-setup.sh` at the first prompt.
- All configurable script options are noted at the start of `1-setup.sh` under **Silent setup options**. Re-run the edited setup script after making your changes. (Run this locally, do not re-run the automatic install web link). 
- Certain combinations of the **Silent setup options** will allow for a fully unattended install supporting mass deployment or highly customized docker builds.

**Other useful custom install notes:**
- **Caution:** Re-running the auto-installer re-downloads the suite of scripts and this will overwrite all your script edits. You must therefore run 1-setup.sh LOCALLY after editing. If any other scripts are edited, their corresponding download links in the 1-setup.sh script must also be commented out.
- Scripts are **automatically updated with your chosen installation settings at 1st install** to create a matched set for consistent future upgrades or feature additions. (Re-downloading from the auto install link will overwrite these updates.)
- Nginx reverse proxy is configured to default to at least TLS 1.2. For ancient systems, see commented sections of the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file after install.
- A daily MySQL backup job is automatically configured under the script owner's crontab.
- **Security note:** The Quick Connect option brings some extra security implications, be aware of potential risks in your environment.

**Post-install hardening script options available:**

- `add-fail2ban.sh`: Adds a lockdown policy for Guacamole to guard against brute force password attacks.
- `add-tls-guac-daemon.sh`: Wraps internal traffic between the guac server & guac application in TLS.
- `add-auth-ldap.sh`: Template script for simplified Active Directory SSO integration.
- `add-smtp-relay-o365.sh`: Template script for email alert integration with MSO65 (BYO app password).

## Customise & Brand Your Guacamole Theme

üé® **Want to give Guacamole your own personal touch? Follow the theme and branding instructions** [here](https://github.com/flyingsquirrel85/itiligent_Guacamole-Installer/tree/main/guac-custom-theme-builder). To revert to the default theme, after install simply delete the branding.jar file from `/etc/guacamole/extensions`, clear your browser cache, then run:

```shell
TOMCAT=$(ls /etc/ | grep tomcat) && sudo systemctl restart ${TOMCAT} && sudo systemctl restart guacd
```

## Managing Self-Signed TLS Certs with Nginx (the Easy Way!)

**To renew self-signed certificates or change the reverse proxy local DNS name/IP address:** 
- Re-run `4a-install-tls-self-signed-nginx.sh` to create a new certificate for Nginx (accompanying browser client certificates will also be updated). Refer to the script's comments for further command line options and always clear your browser cache after changing certificates.

## Active Directory SSO Integration

üîë **Need help with Active Directory integration & SSO authentication?** Check [here](https://github.com/flyingsquirrel85/itiligent_Guacamole-Installer/blob/main/ACTIVE-DIRECTORY-HOW-TO.md).

## Upgrading Guacamole

üåê **To upgrade Guacamole, edit `upgrade-guacamole.sh` to reflect the latest versions of Guacamole & MySQL connector/J before running.** This script will also automatically update TOTP, DUO, LDAP, Quick Connect, and History Recorded Storage extensions if present.

## High Availability Deployment

üëî **Did you know that Guacamole can run in a load-balanced high availability farm with layered physical/virtual separation between front end, application, and database layers?**

- **For a separate DATABASE layer:** Use the `install-mysql-backend-only.sh` [here](https://github.com/flyingsquirrel85/itiligent_Guacamole-Installer/blob/main/guac-enterprise-build/install-mysql-backend-only.sh) to install a standalone instance of the Guacamole MySQL database.
- **For a separate APPLICATION layer:** Run 1-setup.sh and point new installations to your separate/remote backend database. Just say **no** to the "Install MySQL locally" option and any other local reverse proxy install options.
- **For a separate WEB layer:** Use the included Nginx installer scripts to build the basis of a separate TLS front end layer, and then apply your preferred Nginx load balancing technique. There are too many load balancing strategies to list here, but as an example [HA Proxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) generally provides superior session persistence & affinity under load-balanced conditions [compared to Open Source Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/compare-models/).
